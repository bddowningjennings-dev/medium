# **How (and why) am I wasting everyday?**

## An honest failure's blog


### Blog Day 1: 

How did I waste yet another day? I even had a trivial goal for today. Today I was going to save knowing everything for tomorrow and **focus** on a single, realistic and achievable goal. So, how exactly did I fail?

I only wanted to set up a **basic** [RESTful] [API] on an [EC2] instance and [fetch] from the endpoints to interact with the data of a **simple** static site hosted on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. To put it **trivially**, I wanted to use an Ubuntu instance on an Amazon machine to serve routes associated to [mongoose]-registered models' contoller methods which enact the basic [CRUD] opperations on my [NoSQL] [mongoDB] database collections.

**Easy.** Probably like, at most, ~4-5 hours to bust this out. Oh, plus I want to start writing [Medium] stories and tutorials and using [GitHub Gists] for a blog because my loose goal yesterday (after reading a few inspiring articles: [one] [two] [three]) was to create clever and impressive portfolio and personal blog sites so that recruiters for various top companies that would **soon** be fighting over me to **finally** view my projects and musings.

I mean, going into this I know that I haven't had a ton of experience with EC2 or even GitHub Pages... But, I've recently set up a local [Node.js] server using [Express]. Heck, I even connected it to mongoDB using mongoose and set up all the models and controllers (one of each, actually) for adding "Task" documents for a to-do-list style task tracking app. Like, I'm waiting for top companies to start fighting over my developer skills and all.
